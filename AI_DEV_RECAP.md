### Features Implemented

1. **Weekly checklist structure**: Weeks → Categories → Tasks → Sub-tasks
2. **Three task modes**: Carry Over (rolls if incomplete), Repeating (every week, resets), One-Time (never carries)
3. **JSON persistence**: Two files — `checklist.json` (week data), `settings.json` (preferences)
4. **Weekly rollover**: `ensureWeekExists(for:)` creates new weeks from prior week's categories. Respects all three task modes.
5. **Week navigation**: Centered capsule with previous/next arrows + calendar date picker below title
6. **Edit mode**: Pencil/checkmark toggle in bottom-right. Enables:
   - Add categories (dashed-border card appears in grid)
   - Inline task title editing (double-tap or tap in edit mode)
   - Inline mode icons per task (carry-over, repeating, one-time + delete) — shown IN edit mode
   - Task type icons (checkbox/goal) — shown when NOT in edit mode
   - Sub-task management (add, edit, delete, complete)
   - Category removal via context menu (save, remove this week, delete entirely)
7. **Saved category templates**: Categories saved for reuse. Add Category sheet shows "Create New" first, then saved.
8. **Appearance system**: System / Light / Dark / Retro in Settings — fully reactive theme system
9. **Four-step onboarding**:
   - Screen 1: Brief Tasquel summary (auto carry-over focus)
   - Screen 2: Granular feature breakdown (task modes, checkbox vs goal)
   - Screen 3: Username input (1–20 chars, stored in UserDefaults)
   - Screen 4: Category setup grid (2-column grid of defaults to accept/delete + add custom) with "Let's Go!" button
10. **Help sheet**: Detailed instructions on all features including task types and card grid, accessed from Settings
11. **Context menus**: On category cards (save, remove, delete) and task rows (mode, type, edit, subtasks, delete)
12. **iOS 26 Liquid Glass**: Auto-adopted via Xcode 26 (controls, sheets, materials)
13. **Goal-based tasks**:
    - `TaskType` enum: `.checkbox` (default), `.goal`
    - Goal fields on `ChecklistTask`: `goalTarget`, `goalProgress`, `goalUnit`
    - Progress ring indicator on left (replaces checkbox)
    - Inline progress section: ProgressView bar, fraction display, "Add progress" input — always visible (not behind a tap)
    - Inline goal setup: Target/Unit text fields when no target set (not a popup)
    - Auto-completion when progress >= target
    - Task type picker via inline icons and context menu
14. **Username**: Persisted via UserDefaults, editable in Settings, collected during onboarding
15. **Double-tap editing**: Double-tap task title to edit inline
16. **Date banner**: Shows today's date with ordinal suffix (e.g. "Monday, Feb 16th"), "Go to Today" button on non-current weeks
17. **Past week read-only**: Past weeks hide AddTaskRow, AddCategory, and edit button
18. **Future week full editing**: Same capabilities as current week — add/remove tasks and categories
19. **Future week sync**: `syncFutureWeek(for:)` ensures all categories and recurring tasks from the source week appear in future weeks.
20. **Card-based grid UI** (Figma redesign):
    - Replaced `NavigationStack` + `List` with `ZStack` + `ScrollView` + `LazyVGrid`
    - Collapsed cards in 2-column grid with SF Symbol, name, pie chart completion icon, completed count, task dot previews, expand arrow (↗)
    - Single expanded category (`UUID?`) instead of `Set<UUID>` — tapping a card expands it full-width
    - Expanded card shows all tasks with circles (filled green = done, empty = not), subtasks, add-task field, edit/checkmark toggle
    - Edit mode shows inline HStack of mode icons (carry-over, repeating, one-time) + red trash per task
    - Dashed-border "Add Category" card appears in grid during edit mode
    - Cards use theme-adaptive backgrounds with subtle shadow
    - Bottom bar: settings gear (left), date with "Go to Today" (center), edit pencil/checkmark (right)
    - Removed swipe actions (not supported outside List), replaced with inline edit-mode icons + context menus
21. **Pie chart completion icon**: `chart.pie.fill` on each card — green (all complete), orange (partial), red (none complete)
22. **Always-visible subtask creation**: "+" add sub-task field always visible below checkbox tasks (not gated behind existing subtasks)
23. **Auto-complete parent from subtasks**: When all subtasks are completed, parent task auto-completes. When a subtask is unchecked, parent auto-uncompletes.
24. **Dual inline icon system**: Task type icons (checkbox/goal) shown when NOT in edit mode; task mode icons (carry-over/repeating/one-time + delete) shown IN edit mode. Both always show both options with active one highlighted blue.
25. **Theme system** (function-based, fully reactive):
    - `Theme` enum with static functions taking `AppearanceMode` parameter — SwiftUI observation-compatible
    - System/Light: adaptive UIKit colors (`Color(.label)`, `Color(.systemBackground)`, etc.)
    - Dark: explicit white/gray/dark colors
    - Retro: terminal phosphor colors via `retroPalette()` function
    - Every view has `private var theme: AppearanceMode { store.appearanceMode }` computed property
    - Color functions: `textPrimary`, `textSecondary`, `textTertiary`, `accent`, `background`, `cardFill`, `cardBorder`, `cardShadow`, `dotComplete`, `completionAll/Some/None`
26. **Retro terminal theme**:
    - Monospaced font throughout (`.system(.body, design: .monospaced)`)
    - Terminal-style card borders (`[ CATEGORY ]`, `[ ] Task`, `[OPEN]`)
    - Cursor-blinking title with trailing underscore (`> Week of 2/16/26_`)
    - CRT-style scanline overlay on cards
    - Settings and Help sheets have dual rendering paths (standard List vs retro ScrollView with terminal-styled sections)
27. **Retro color palette**: 6 terminal phosphor colors (green, amber, blue, white, red, purple), each with 3 brightness levels (bright, dim, faint). Selectable in Settings when retro theme is active. Persisted via `settings.json`.

### UI Layout (Post-Redesign)

- **Root**: `ZStack` with `Theme.background()` adaptive background
- **Title**: "Week of M/d/yy" centered, `.title.bold()` (monospaced with cursor in retro mode)
- **Navigation capsule**: Centered `HStack` with `< calendar >` in theme-adaptive capsule
- **Content**: `ScrollView` + `LazyVGrid` (2 flexible columns, 16pt spacing)
- **Expanded card**: Full-width `VStack` at top of scroll, collapsed cards in grid below
- **Bottom bar**: `HStack` — gear circle (left), date text (center), pencil/checkmark circle (right)
- **Edit-done button**: Green-tinted `checkmark` with green background + ring when active
- **Add Category**: Dashed-border card in grid during edit mode
- **Card backgrounds**: Theme-adaptive fill in `RoundedRectangle(cornerRadius: 16)` with soft shadow (retro uses dark bg + colored border)
- **Inline icons per task**:
  - Normal mode: checkbox + goal type icons (switch task type)
  - Edit mode: carry-over + repeating + one-time mode icons + trash (switch task mode, delete)

## Development Workflow

- Build after each checkpoint: `xcodebuild -project Tasquel.xcodeproj -scheme Tasquel -destination 'platform=iOS Simulator,name=iPhone 17 Pro' build`
- Install to sim: `xcrun simctl install 66BC7B60-5C39-4599-BAD6-839C1BA81204 ~/Library/Developer/Xcode/DerivedData/Tasquel-aviiopvkyuygsagufoplyonwfrif/Build/Products/Debug-iphonesimulator/Tasquel.app`
- Launch: `xcrun simctl launch 66BC7B60-5C39-4599-BAD6-839C1BA81204 com.symonym.Tasquel`
- Screenshot: `xcrun simctl io 66BC7B60-5C39-4599-BAD6-839C1BA81204 screenshot /tmp/tasquel.png`
- Fresh install test: `xcrun simctl uninstall ... && xcrun simctl install ...`
- New files in `Tasquel/` are auto-discovered (`PBXFileSystemSynchronizedRootGroup`)
- DerivedData path changed: `Tasquel-aviiopvkyuygsagufoplyonwfrif` (was `Tasquel-enfbpsqjcwhtrgdnotmnlfnayzgj`)

## Key Decisions & Gotchas

1. **Simulator name**: `iPhone 16` doesn't exist in Xcode 26.2 — use `iPhone 17 Pro`
2. **Init order in ChecklistStore**: Must seed `savedCategories` BEFORE `ensureWeekExists(for:)`, otherwise first week gets 0 categories
3. **No simctl tap**: `xcrun simctl io input tap` doesn't exist — can't programmatically interact with UI, only screenshot
4. **`.quaternary` type mismatch**: Can't use `.quaternary` in ternary with `Color` — use `Color.secondary` instead
5. **Settings JSON UUIDs**: When manually editing `settings.json` for testing, UUIDs must be valid format (e.g., `A1B2C3D4-E5F6-7890-ABCD-EF1234567890`), not short strings
6. **GitHub auth**: Uses `gh` CLI (installed via Homebrew), HTTPS protocol, account `SymonymD`
7. **Monday-based weeks**: Must set `calendar.firstWeekday = 2` in `mondayOfWeek(containing:)` — US locale defaults to Sunday which caused Sunday dates to map to the wrong week
8. **Future week stale data**: `ensureWeekExists` only creates a week once. If you navigate to a future week, go back, add recurring tasks, then navigate forward again, those tasks won't appear unless explicitly synced. Fixed with `syncFutureWeek(for:)` which runs on every future-week navigation.
9. **Category UUIDs differ per week**: Each week gets fresh category UUIDs from rollForward. Expansion tracking must use single `UUID?` (not `Set<UUID>`) and reset on week navigation.
10. **SourceKit false positives**: Cross-file resolution errors like `Cannot find 'Category' in scope` or `Category (aka 'OpaquePointer')` are transient SourceKit issues — all builds succeed. Ignore these diagnostics.
11. **Swipe actions require List**: `swipeActions` modifier only works inside `List`. After migrating to `ScrollView` + `LazyVGrid`, swipe actions were replaced with inline edit-mode icons and context menus.
12. **Rollover resets completed tasks on test data**: When writing test data directly to `checklist.json`, the `ensureWeekExists` init logic may strip completed carry-over tasks and one-time tasks. Completed tasks show as red dots because rollover reset them. This is correct app behavior — only affects manual test data injection.
13. **Inline icon context matters**: Task type icons (checkbox/goal) show when NOT in edit mode so users can always switch type. Task mode icons (carry-over/repeating/one-time) show IN edit mode. Initially had this reversed — user corrected that mode changes are an "editing" action while type switching should be always available.
14. **Theme static var not observable**: `nonisolated(unsafe) static var mode` on Theme couldn't be tracked by SwiftUI observation. Fixed by converting all Theme properties to functions taking `AppearanceMode` parameter, with each view reading `store.appearanceMode` via computed property.
15. **`.buttonStyle(.plain)` suppresses taps in List**: Appearance toggle buttons in Settings became untappable. Fixed by removing `.buttonStyle(.plain)` from buttons inside List rows.
16. **Sheets don't inherit preferredColorScheme**: Sheets have their own window and need `.preferredColorScheme()` applied directly — won't inherit from parent view hierarchy.
17. **awk bulk Theme replacement pitfall**: `Theme.cardBorder` was a substring of `Theme.cardBorderWidth`, causing awk to produce `Theme.cardBorder(theme)Width`. Must handle longer names first or use exact-match patterns.

## Figma Reference

- **File key**: `m5BPKMcJmfaMXsMmpAFzjF`
- **State_Default** (node `91:926`): 2-column grid of dark rounded cards, title centered, nav capsule, bottom bar

- Unit tests (test targets exist but no tests written yet)
- iPad-specific layout optimizations
- Data export/import

## Last Session Summary (2026-02-16)

**What was done**: Full theme system rebuild and retro terminal theme:
- **Theme system rebuild**: Converted from static var (unobservable) to function-based system taking `AppearanceMode` parameter. All ~145+ call sites updated. Every view has `theme` and `rc` computed properties.
- **4-mode appearance**: System (adaptive UIKit colors), Light (adaptive UIKit colors), Dark (explicit white/dark), Retro (terminal phosphor)
- **Retro terminal styling**: Monospaced fonts, `[ BRACKET ]` card/task formatting, cursor-blinking title, CRT scanline overlay, dark backgrounds with colored borders
- **Retro Settings/Help**: Dual rendering paths — standard List for system/light/dark, custom terminal-styled ScrollView for retro
- **Retro color palette**: 6 phosphor colors (green, amber, blue, white, red, purple) with 3 brightness levels each. Persisted via settings.json, selectable in Settings when retro theme is active.
- **Bug fixes**: `.buttonStyle(.plain)` tap suppression in List, sheet color scheme inheritance, card shadow intensity in light mode
- All changes build successfully (BUILD SUCCEEDED)

**User's likely next steps**: Continue UI refinements or move to new features.
